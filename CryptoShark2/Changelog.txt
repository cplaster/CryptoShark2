CyrptoShark2 is a refactoring of the original CryptoShark code.

*A lot of simplication has been made to the IExchange and I*Message interfaces and their respective implementations.
Likewise for the exchange-specific implementations.

*Standardized BookInfo, CoinInfo, MarketInfo, and SummaryInfo classes which all of the exchange implementations use.

*Better support for CryptoCompare queries.

*A more sane MainWindow testbed

*The CandleChart custom control, which can render market history candles.

The next step is to create a decent UI which uses all of this stuff :-)
